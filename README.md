# Brain-Drain
 The project mainly focuses on the Indian Scenario i.e. brain drain from India to other countries. A report by Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) pointed out that when a large number of students flocking to foreign universities, it costs India a whooping Rs. 95,000 crores per year. The report further noted that there is a huge difference in the fees paid by the students studying in the premier institutes in India as compared to the students who study aboard. While an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) student has to pay an average fee of $150 per month, the fee paid by an Indian student studying abroad per month is anywhere between $1,500 and $4,000.
