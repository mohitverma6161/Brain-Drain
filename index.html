 The project mainly focuses on the Indian Scenario i.e. brain drain from India to other countries. A report by Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) pointed out that when a large number of students flocking to foreign universities, it costs India a whooping Rs. 95,000 crores per year. The report further noted that there is a huge difference in the fees paid by the students studying in the premier institutes in India as compared to the students who study aboard. While an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) student has to pay an average fee of $150 per month, the fee paid by an Indian student studying abroad per month is anywhere
between $1,500 and $4,000.

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p style="color:white;">The Indian Government must understand the problem of brain drain and its consequences towards Indian Economy. Government should support all categories of people of India financially, technically, and professionally, so that they have an incentive to stay in the country and not leave it. Where there is an effective utilization of human knowledge is possible then there, we can see the growth rate of economy in terms of all aspects and on GDP rate. Moreover, the Government must amend policies in higher education, so that our talent can be discouraged to settle in other countries. The recent success of India in 'Mars Orbiter' Project was due to highly motivated scientists, who work day and night for their nation despite going abroad. Had these scientists gone abroad, the above space project would never be a great success. So, Indian Government must redress the above issue of Brain drain and may take initiative to retain our best brains. 

The balance of power and for the staggered development of the world, it is very important to stop the phenomena of Brain-drain. This will help the country use all local skilled citizens for development and to attain higher GDP. But to hold these skilled workers at their native places, it is also important to provide them enough work opportunities and living facilities. For this purpose, our Government must take initiatives and amend policies or developed nations may help developing countries with necessary money and resources. Sovereign nations seem unlikely to relinquish regulation of immigration policy to the type of outside body such as a World Migration Organization. After all, the arrangement currently works in Western nation's favor. As developed countries see more of their educated young people leaving for jobs in other, wealthier nations, perhaps demand for such a body will increase. 

But brain drain can be positive as well.

Brain drain allows many highly skilled people to find well-paying jobs outside India. This way other skilled people will find opportunities in India. This would reduce the percentage of jobless people.
The income from the emigrated people comes back to India as overseas remittances. Currently India is recipient of the highest amount of foreign currency coming in as remittances from NRIs. It helps improve the education and infrastructure in India, which in turn develops country further. For example, brain drain was the major cause for the growth of software education.
The most important effect of brain drain is brain circulation, which is the circular movement of skilled labor across nations. Countries like Taiwan, China and India have profited enormously form brain circulation. Global connectivity has led to a two-way flow of ideas, knowledge, and investments. 
Brain drain has led to the growth of various fields which led to the return of many people. 
India is indeed rapidly becoming a global research, design and development hub. More than 1,000 companies from around the world have set up their R&D centers in India. Over 2,00,000 scientists and engineers are working there, at least a fourth of whom have returned from overseas.
